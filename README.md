Things i learned 9-5-22
Type conversion
code structure
basic operators(math)
variable
Data types
String 
arrays
Objects

.....
`live share` install extension
`live share` use
anydesk(remote desktop application)
<script src = ".\scripts\index.js " ></script> tag(js in html)
live Server for JS (:5555 port)
Emmet Extension use(! ,   #root -> tab)


ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
    <App />
) 
ReactDOM => import ... 'react-dom/client'

Variable Declaration, Variable Assignment, Variable Types..
String and number using operators like = ,- , +, >, <;
   Operator = ,- ,+ ,> ,< ;
Number
Boolean(True, False) while doing comparision the output is always boolean value
Implicit Type Conversion
let 'x' = "10";
let x = "10";(doesnt need to define x as string)

console.log(); use of console.log
Null 
undefined x 
console.log(typeof(variable)); typeof is used to address the data types

Pass by value(let value = 1; value =2; console.log(value) output is 1 because the value is predefined at first and also known as pass by value)
pop and push methods()

bigInt(denoted by n after number like 12334223423423425235234n.. helps is big numbers calculation)\

Use of useState hook using button as example(changing the value when the button clicks)
const [value, setValue]= useState();
console.log(value++);

JSX and its basic features(JSX= JS and XML code)





Object
An object can be created with figure brackets {…} with an optional list of properties. "," is used for continuing properties
A property is a “key: value” pair, where key is a string (also called a “property name”),
Ex
let ram = {
age : 21,
sex : "zero"
};

Array
let class = ["1", "2", "3"];
each arrays are defined with index number ("1" = index 0 "2" = index 1 and so on)

Topic : Array Methods. (push, pop, shift, unshift) --->> map,filter,reduce,find
 
let c = ["1", "2", "3"];
let names = ["RAHUL", "ASDAS", "DDDDD"];

names.map(name => <li>{name}</li>);

["<li>RAHUL</li>", "<li>ASDAS</li>", "<li>DDDDD</li>"]



// arrow function







let Car = [
    { Suzuki : "M20", Milage : 36 },
    { Honda : "C90", Milage : 14 },
    { toyota : "Golden1", Milage: 28 }
];
